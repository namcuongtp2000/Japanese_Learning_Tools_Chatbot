Firstly, you can start with learning hiragana alphabet and try to remember, read them as much as possible by spending 30 minutes to 1 hour a day. After that, you can try to write what you learned and practice simple pronunciations, that's very important and certainly helpful for you in the future. Next, you can try katakana alphabet with the same steps but don't touch kanji too early. Move to N5 simple grammars and try to learn,speak and write greetings sample sentences by hiragana. Move to next harder grammars from N5 to N4 and continue keep practicing. When you end N5, you can start learning Kanji by remembering, reading and writing through grammars and sentences in lectures. That's all preparation steps to become master Japanese. If you can't learn yourself, you can learn at any reputation Japanese centers and some of them, I will mention if you ask. "],
